**Authors: Michael Eirikson, Raymond Wang, Alexander Wen**

Basic data analysis on predicting the species of a tree in Vancouver following sound data scientific workflows as part of the main project for DSCI 522 (Data Science Workflows), a course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

## Dependencies

The dependencies for this project are everything listed in [environment.yml](https://github.com/alxwen711/vancouver_tree_predictions/main/environment.yml) as well as the following:

(NOTE: this is to be refined further once the basic environment.yml file is setup)

```
conda (version 25.3.1 or higher)
conda-lock (version 3.0.4 or higher)
jupyterlab (version 4.0.0 or higher)
```


## Initial Setup

If this is the first time running this project, run the following from the repository root to setup the virtual environment:

```
conda-lock install --name vancouver_tree_predictions conda-lock.yml
```

## Usage

Assuming the initial setup is complete, to run the analysis, navigate to `vancouver_tree_predictions_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab. Select the Kernel `vancouver_tree_predictions`, and then under the `Kernel` menu, click `Restart Kernel and Run All Cells`.
