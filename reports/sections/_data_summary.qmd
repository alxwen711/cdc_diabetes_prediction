```{python}
#| label: tbl-describe
#| tbl-cap: Description of the training data.
describe_df = pd.read_csv("../results/tables/EDA_describe.csv").T
describe_df.columns = [""] * len(describe_df.columns)
describe_df = describe_df
Markdown(describe_df.to_markdown(index = True))
```

@tbl-describe displays a numerical distribution of the dataset, where as @tbl-head lists the first 5 rows transposed of the training dataset as example observations used. Both tables have been transposed from their original form for more syntactical presentation. All features of the dataset consist entirely of integer values, and by all `count` values being identically 177576 (the number of observations in the training dataset), there exist no null values, making the preprocessing step of the analysis relatively simple. 

```{python}
#| label: tbl-head
#| tbl-cap: First few rows of the training data as example observations.
head_df = pd.read_csv("../results/tables/EDA_head.csv").T
#head_df.columns = [""] * len(head_df.columns)
Markdown(head_df.to_markdown(index = True))
```
