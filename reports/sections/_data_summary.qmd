```{python}
#| label: tbl-describe
#| tbl-cap: Description of the training data.
describe_df = pd.read_csv("../results/tables/EDA_describe.csv").T.round(4)
describe_df.columns = [""] * len(describe_df.columns)
Markdown(describe_df.to_markdown(index = True))
```

@tbl-describe displays a numerical distribution of the dataset. Note that this and @tbl-head are transposed tables for more syntactical presentation. All features of the dataset are numeric, and further EDA shows there are no null values in the dataset. Most features are binary in nature, with the exceptions of  To better visualize we then plotted frequency counts of the target labels:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-head
#| tbl-cap: First few rows of the training data as example observations.
head_df = pd.read_csv("../results/tables/EDA_head.csv").T
head_df.columns = [""] * len(head_df.columns)
Markdown(head_df.to_markdown(index = True))
```

Here are some examples of our data.
