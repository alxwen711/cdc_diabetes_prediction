First, here is a sample of the training data showing the first few entries and last few entries in the dataset in @tbl-head and @tbl-tail.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-head
#| tbl-cap: First few rows of the training data.
head_df = pd.read_csv("../results/tables/EDA_head.csv")
Markdown(head_df.to_markdown(index = True))
```


```{python}
#| label: tbl-tail
#| tbl-cap: Last few rows of the training data.
tail_df = pd.read_csv("../results/tables/EDA_tail.csv")
Markdown(tail_df.to_markdown(index = True))
```

All features of the dataset are numeric, and further EDA shows there are no null values in the dataset.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-describe
#| tbl-cap: Description of the training data.
describe_df = pd.read_csv("../results/tables/EDA_describe.csv")
Markdown(describe_df.to_markdown(index = True))
```

@tbl-describe displays a numerical distribution of the dataset. Most features are binary in nature, with the exceptions of  To better visualize we then plotted frequency counts of the target labels:
