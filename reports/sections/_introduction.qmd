In Canada and the USA approximately 10% of people are living with diabetes. In Canada in 2023 approximately 3.7 million people were living with diabetes and in the USA in 2021 approzimately 38.4 million people were living with diabetes. (@diabetescanada) In the USA it is the 8th leading cause of death. (@usarenal) Globally an estimated 44% of people living with diabetes are undiagnosed. (@diabetescare)

In this project we try to predicted diabetes disease based on common health factors. A reliable model could help to prescreen people and recommend following up with a physician for people who are at risk. Given the large number of people living with undiagnosed diabetes this could potentially have a significant positive impact of world health.

The analysis uses the American CDC Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (UCI ID 891), containing 253,680 survey responses with 21 health-related features and a binary diabetes outcome (0 = no diabetes/pre-diabetes, 1 = diabetes).

No missing values were present and all features were already encoded numerically. The target classes is imbalanced (≈86% non-diabetic, ≈14% diabetic).
