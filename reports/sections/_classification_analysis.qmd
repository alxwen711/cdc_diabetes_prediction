### Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

We performed grid search cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters for both models:

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pickle

# Load the saved models (this is fast)
with open("../results/models/tree_model.pickle", "rb") as f:
    best_tree = pickle.load(f)
    
with open("../results/models/naive_bayes_model.pickle", "rb") as f:
    best_nb = pickle.load(f)
```

Decision Tree Classifier:
-   Best max_depth: `{python} best_tree.max_depth`
-   Best min_samples_leaf: `{python} best_tree.min_samples_leaf` 

Naive Bayes Classifier:  
-   Best alpha parameter: `{python} best_nb.named_steps['bernoullinb'].alpha`

The grid search process identified optimal hyperparameters that balance model complexity with predictive performance. The Decision Tree was configured with a maximum depth of `{python} best_tree.max_depth` and minimum samples per leaf of `{python} best_tree.min_samples_leaf`, while the Naive Bayes model used an alpha smoothing parameter of `{python} best_nb. named_steps['bernoullinb'].alpha`.
