#### Performance Table

The following table summarizes the performance metrics for our two models evaluated on the test set:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-performance-metrics
#| tbl-cap: "Comparison of model performance metrics on the test set"
#| echo: false

import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import Markdown

table_to_display = pd.read_csv("../results/tables/model_scores.csv")
Markdown(table_to_display.to_markdown(index=False))
```

As shown in @tbl-performance-metrics, the Decision Tree model demonstrates superior performance across all evaluation metrics compared to the Naive Bayes model. The Decision Tree achieves higher accuracy, f2-score, recall, and precision scores, making it the optimal choice for our diabetes prediction task.

#### Performance Visualization

The performance comparison in @fig-performance-comparison demonstrates that the Decision Tree model outperforms the Naive Bayes model across all evaluation metrics.

#### Confusion Matrix
